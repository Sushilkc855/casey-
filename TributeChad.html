  <h3>About </h3>
  <p> <strong> Chadwick Aaron Boseman </strong> (November 29, 1976 – August 28, 2020) was an American actor, director and producer.
    After studying directing at Howard University, he landed his first major role as a series regular on Persons Unknown (2010). Boseman's
    breakthrough performance came as baseball player Jackie Robinson in the biographical film 42 (2013). He continued to portray historical figures,
    starring in Get on Up (2014) as singer James Brown and Marshall (2017) as Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Boseman achieved international
    fame for playing superhero Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) from 2016 to 2019. He appeared in four MCU films, including an
    eponymous 2018 film that earned him an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding
    Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. His final film, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, is scheduled to be released posthumously. In 2016, Boseman

                 <h3>#5. The Express</h3>
             </div>
             <p class="character-description">It’s another football movie, this one with an even smaller role for Boseman. It’s Boseman’s first feature credit. The movie as a whole is a solid biopic. Following the life of Ernie Davis, it is a traditional inspirational film.
                Often it doesn’t transcend the cliches of the genre, but the performances alone are enough to elevate the film particularly from its lead, Rob Brown. It’s earnest and effective at the message it is trying to convey.</p>

               <h4> #4. 42 </h4>
         <p class="character-description">A baseball icon, Jackie Robinson broke all kinds of barriers. Boseman plays Robinson in this biopic. Though the movie ultimately plays it a little safe, it’s fascinating none the less. Director Biran Helgeland never goes too deep,        but does an admirable job of exploring the man and the incredible story around him. Harrison Ford is surprisingly solid as is the rest of the supporting cast. Robinson legacy is done with justice in this riveting portrait of an American story.</p>

               <h4> #3. Marshall </h4>
             <p class="character-description">Tackling his third biopic, Boseman steps into the shoes of Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American Supreme Court Judge. Rather than that aspect of his life, the movie focuses on Marshall’s early days as a lawyer,
                 trying a case in Connecticut. Boseman gives a quiet but confident performance in the film and the cast around him is excellent as well. The movie harkens back to the days of great courtroom dramas. Reflecting upon some topical social themes,
             Marshall succeeds on that promise without ever being heavy-handed.  </p>

       <h4> #2. Get On Up  </h4>
     <p class="character-description">Boseman expertly navigates the larger than life personality that was James Brown. Nailing every aspect of the character, Boseman is electrifying. The movie winds through Brown’s life touching on the dark and the light of one of the kings of soul music.
    Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer also offer up excellent supporting work. Though it often feels a little unfocused from Tate Taylor‘s direction, Boseman’s work is always what keeps you invested.</p>

     <h4>#1. Black Panther </h4>
     <p class="character-description">It’s undeniable this is Boseman’s movie. Smaller parts in the above mentioned MCU films are ones he is great in. However, given his own movie to shine, Boseman and company nail Black Panther. The film is one of the best in the long-running franchise and
    certainly among its most visually thrilling. Chock full of excellent performances, Ryan Coogler really brings something special to this film. Coogler does some excellent world-building while inserting fully fleshed out characters that from the get-go
          we have an emotional attachment to. That’s a very hard thing to do, and the movie crushes every aspect.</p>
